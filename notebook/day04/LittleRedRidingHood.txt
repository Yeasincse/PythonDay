All the better to hug you with, my dear.
Grandmother, what big legs you have!
All the better to run with, my child.
Grandmother, what big ears you have!
All the better to hear with, my child.
Grandmother, what big eyes you have!
All the better to see with, my child.
Grandmother, what big teeth you have got!
All the better to eat you up with.
